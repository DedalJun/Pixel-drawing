# Pixel-drawing

A simple program that shows how the line is drawn by pixels. The idea is this: the window that appears after entering the coordinates of the imaginary line is something like a monitor, and the square is a pixel. If the imaginary line passes through a square (pixel), then it should be drawn. The project uses the Glut graphics library
